# Integration Contracts -- RD2100 Agent Runtime v2

> **Phase 2 Update (2026-05-30)**: BoundaryEnvelope schema defined for future cross-project data flows (Phase 6).
> See `schemas/draft/boundary-envelope.schema.draft.json` (inactive, Phase 6 candidate).


> Batch B1R, 2026-05-27
> Defines 8 core data contracts for the agent runtime.
> Phase 0-5: contracts are defined but not enforced by automated validation.

## Core Contracts (8)

Every agent execution within the runtime produces and consumes these contract types.
Each contract defines: purpose, producer, consumer, required/optional fields, status enum, minimal JSON example, and validation rules.

---

## Contract 1: TaskSpec

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Purpose** | Describe a unit of work before execution begins |
| **Producer** | Planner agent or human operator |
| **Consumer** | Executor agent |
| **Status enum** | `draft`, `ready`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `closed`, `deferred`, `rejected`, `accepted_with_limitation`, `pending_human_decision` |
| **Formats** | JSON schema (`task-spec.schema.json`) for machine validation; markdown (SADP protocol section 1) for human-readable dispatch |

### Dual-Format Contract

TaskSpec has one canonical machine contract and one authoring representation:

- **JSON schema** (`schemas/agent-runtime/task-spec.schema.json`): canonical closed machine contract. Used by dispatch plan validators and automated consumers. Unknown or misspelled fields are rejected.
- **Markdown** (SADP protocol section 1): human-readable authoring representation used for agent-to-agent instructions. It must be normalized into the canonical JSON fields before machine validation.

Markdown-only fields are operational instructions, not undeclared JSON extensions. A consumer must map them through the table below; it must not copy arbitrary markdown labels into canonical JSON.

### Field Mapping (JSON ↔ Markdown)

| JSON Schema Field | Markdown Field | Present In | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `task_id` | ID | Both | |
| `title` | (in heading `## Task: [title]`) | Both | |
| `priority` | Priority | Both | |
| `status` | (implicit from workflow) | JSON only | Markdown uses workflow position |
| `description` | Goal + Context | Both | Markdown splits into two fields |
| `depends_on` | (workflow ordering) | JSON only | Markdown uses implicit ordering |
| `assumptions` | Context (partial) | Both | |
| `risk_notes` | Risk | Both | JSON: string; Markdown: enum label |
| `estimated_tools` | (not in markdown) | JSON only | |
| `gate_0` | Gate 0 Ledger | Both | YAML embedded in markdown |
| `conflict_registry` | Conflict Registry | Both | YAML embedded in markdown |
| `security_report` | (not in markdown) | JSON only | Checklist for task completion |
| — | Batch | Markdown only | Organizational grouping |
| — | Allowed Files | Markdown only | Covered by `conflict_registry.write_set` in JSON |
| — | Forbidden | Markdown only | Covered by `deny_paths` in TaskSpec YAML |
| — | Acceptance Gates | Markdown only | Evaluated by the task runner and external review; not copied into TaskSpec JSON |
| — | Expected Output | Markdown only | Covered by `conflict_registry.write_set` in JSON |

## Appendix: System Integration Notes

These are notes on external system interfaces. They are NOT core contracts.
Core contracts are the 8 defined above.

### A1: ai-workflow-hub (Upstream CLI)
- **Status**: FIXED (Batch E) -- README.md references corrected to `D:\dev-frame`. Claude memory alias `D--devFrame` remains as P3 cosmetic issue.
- **Interface**: CLI via `$env:AI_WORKFLOW_HUB`
- **Direction**: agent-acceptance calls ai-workflow-hub CLI

### A2: CodeGraph (Code Intelligence)
- **Status**: ACTIVE -- dev-frame: 410 files, test-frame: 102 files, agent-acceptance: 0 files
- **Interface**: MCP (codegraph_* tools)
- **Direction**: Agent queries CodeGraph

- **Interface**: MCP (* tools)
- **Direction**: Bidirectional (read: search/recent knowledge; write: register, share_decision, report_bug_pattern)

### A4: test-frame (Controlled Verification Runtime Candidate)
- **Status**: PHASE_1B_ADAPTER_MAPPING
- **Interface**: Evidence provider contracts, capability profiles, and report artifacts.
- **Direction**: test-frame evidence is consumed by devframe-system planning/review layers.
- **Boundary**: test-frame is a controlled verification runtime candidate. It is not a plugin, not a reviewer, and not a final verdict source.

#### Adapter Mapping

| test-frame surface | devframe-system consumer field | Adapter rule |
|---|---|---|
| `RunSpec.run_id` | adapter run identity | Preserve exactly; every evidence or report reference must point to a known run. |
| `RunSpec.command` | execution command evidence | Preserve exact command text. Non-allowlisted commands must be surfaced as blocking review input, not normalized away. |
| `RunSpec.cwd` | working-directory control | Must be inside the approved project root for the run. Wrong or missing cwd cannot support PASS. |
| `RunSpec.exit_code` | gate status derivation | `0` maps to PASS, `1` maps to BLOCKED, `2` maps to FAILED. Other values are invalid and must not be coerced to PASS. |
| `EvidenceIndex.artifact_path` | evidence artifact pointer | Must stay inside the approved project root and must reference a real artifact when used as current evidence. |
| `EvidenceIndex.freshness` | evidence currency | `historical` and `stale_or_unknown` are context only. Gate evidence requires `current` with reviewer-approved currency. |
| `EvidenceManifest.test_summary` | test evidence summary | A summary line is descriptive evidence only. It cannot by itself create final acceptance. |
| `ExecutionReport.status` | executor-reported outcome | Treat as a claim until supported by RunSpec, EvidenceIndex, reviewer artifacts, and gate checks. |
| `ExecutionReport.reviewer_artifacts` | independent review evidence | Required for pass reports. Reviewer identity must be independent from executor identity. |

#### Status and Profile Semantics

- Required capability/profile gates block unless every required capability returns `PASS`.
- Optional capability probes may return `BLOCKED`, `FAILED`, `UNSUPPORTED`, or `NOT_REQUIRED` without failing a baseline, but they must remain visible in evidence.
- Missing tools, missing browsers, missing devices, missing credentials, disabled real-auth flags, or unreachable endpoints are infrastructure evidence. They must be reported as `BLOCKED` or `FAILED`, never as PASS.
- Allure HTML is PASS only when generation exits successfully and `allure-report/index.html` exists. `allure-generation.json` with `BLOCKED` or `FAILED` is fallback evidence preservation, not HTML success.
- Local fake contracts, local H5 fixtures, and readiness profiles do not prove real H5, MiniApp, MeterSphere, cloud-device, or Android runtime success.

#### Final Verdict Boundary

The adapter may pass through evidence and derived status candidates, but it must not produce final acceptance. Final gate decisions require an independent reviewer or human gate. Summaries, generated reports, and historical artifacts are inputs to review; they are not final verdicts.

### A5: Memory System (Internal)
- **Status**: PARTIAL -- Phase 0-5 read-only, MemoryUpdateRecord proposals only
